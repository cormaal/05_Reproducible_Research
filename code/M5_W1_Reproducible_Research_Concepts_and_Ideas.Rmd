# Reproducible Research: Concepts and Ideas


## What is Reproducible Research About

Not much to say here ... David makes the analogy with music and presents two pieces of music: a relatively simple 'pop' song and a quite complex piece of classical music.

The 'score' allows the conductor to reproduce the intention of the composer.

So for data analysis ... how do you develop the score for data analysis?

There is no real agreed upon 'score' for reproducing work ...

Some people will just describe in words what was done, and in some cases, this is sufficient, but in many cases, it's not.
Some people will provide the computer code and the data and everything that you need, and sometimes that's good.
But sometimes it's enormously complex and it's difficult to sort through.

And so there are a variety of ways that you can communicate data analysis, but we just haven't agreed upon what is a way that is more or less sufficient for everybody.

So, what we're gonna focus on in this course is how to communicate data analysis, using code by writing documents that are very dynamic,
and by sharing data so that other people can reproduce the work that you're doing. 


## Concepts and Ideas (Part 1)

### Replication

The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence is replication of findings and conducting studies with independent:

- investigators
- data
- analytical methods
- laboratories
- instruments

Replication is particularly important in studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions

### What's Wrong with Replication?

Some studies cannot be replicated

- no time, opportunistic
- no money
- unique

Reproducible research: make analytical data and code available so that others may reproduce findings

How can we bridge the gap between replication and doing nothing? Reproducibility is the answer.

### Why do we need reproducible research?

- New technologies increasing data collection throughput; data are more complex and extremely high dimensional

- Existing databases can be merged into new 'megadatabases'

- Computing power is greatly increased, allowing more sophisticated analyses

- For every field 'X' there is a field 'Computational X'

### Example - Reproducible Air Pollution and Health Research

- Estimating small (but important) health effects in the presence of much stronger signals

- Results inform substantial policy decisions, affect many stakeholders
    - EPA regulations can cost billions of dollars

- Complex statistical methods are needed and subject to intense scrutiny

Johns Hopkins have created the Internet-based Health and Air Pollution Surveillance System (iHAPSS) so their research can be reproduced by others
