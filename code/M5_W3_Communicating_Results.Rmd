# Communicating Results

## tl;dr

* People are busy, especially managers and leaders
* Results of data analyses are sometimes presented in oral form, but often the first cut is presented via email
* It is often useful to breakdown the results of an analysis into different levels of granularity / detail

## Hierarchy of information

### Research paper

* Title / author list
* Abstract
* Body / results
* Supplementary materials / the gory details
* Code / data / really gory details

### Email presentation

* Subject line / sender info
    * At a minimum; include one
    * Can you summarise findings in one sentence?
    
* Email body
    * A brief description of the problem / context; recall what was proposed and executed; summarise findings / results / 1-2 paragraphs
    * If action needs to be taken as a result of this presentation, suggest some options and make them as concrete as possible
    * If questions need to be addressed, try to make them yes/no

* Attachment(s)
    * R Markdown file
    * knitr report
    * Stay concise: don't spit out pages of code (because you used knitr we know it's available)

* Links to supplementary materials
    * code / software / data
    * GitHub repository / project web site

# Reproducible Research Checklist

## DO: Start with good science

* Garbage in, garbage out
* Coherent, focused question simplifies many problems
* Working with good collaborators reinforces good practices
* Something that is interesting to you will (hopefully) motivate good habits

## DON'T: Do things by hand

* Editing spreadsheets of data to "clean it up"
    * removing outliers
    * QA / GC
    * Validating
* Editing tables or figures (e.g. rounding, formatting)
* Downloading data from a website (clicking links in a web browser)
* Moving data around your computer; splitting / reformatting data files
* Very tempting to think: "We're just going to do this once ..."

Things done by hand need to be precisely documented (this is harder than it sounds)

## DON'T: Point and click

* Many data processing / statistical analysis packages have graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
* GUIs are convenient / intuitive but the actions you take with a GUI can be difficult for others to reproduce
* Some GUIs produce a log file or script which includes equivalent commands; these can be saved for later examination
* In general, be careful with data analysis software that is highly *interactive*; ease of use can sometimes lead to non-reproducbile analyses
* Other interactive software, such as text editors, are usually fine

## Do: Teach a computer

* If something needs to be done as part of your analysis / investigation, try to teach your computer to do it (even if you only need to do it once)
* In order to give your computer instructions, you need to write down exactly what you mean to do and how it should be done
* Teaching a computer almost guarantees reproducibility

For example, by hand you can:

1. Go to the UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
2. Download the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) by clicking on the Data Folder, then clicking on the link to the zip file of dataset, and choosing "Save Linked File As..." and then saving it to a folder on your computer

Or ... you can teach your computer to do the same thing using R:

```{r}
download.file("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip", "./data/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip")
```

Notice here that:
* The full URL to the dataset is specified (no clicking through a series of links)
* The name of the file saved to your local computer is specified
* The directory in which the file was saved is specified ("data")
* Code can always be executed in R (as long as the link is available)

## DO: Use some version control

* Slow things down
* Add changes in small chunks (don't just do one massive commit)
* Track / tag snapshots; revert to old versions
* Software like GitHub / BitBucket / SourceForge make it easy to publish results

## DO: Keep track of your software environment

* If you work on a complex project involving many tools / datasets, the software and computing environment can be critical for reproducing your analysis
* **Computer architecture**: CPU (Intel, AMD, ARM), GPUs
* **Operating system**: Windows, MAC OS, Linux / Unix
* **Software toolchain**: Compilers, interpreters, command shell, programming languages (C, Perl, Python, etc.), database backends, data analysis software
* **Supporting software / infrastructure**: Libraries, R packages, dependencies
* **External dependencies**: Websites, data repositories, remote databases, software repositories
* **Version numbers**: Ideally, for everything (if available)

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

## DON'T: Save output

* Avoid saving data analysis output (tables, figures, summaries, processed data, etc), except perhaps temporarily for efficiency purposes
* If a stray output file cannot be easily connected with the means by which it was created, then it is not reproducible
* Save the data + code that generated the output, rather than the output itself
* Intermediate files are okay as long as there is clear documentation of how they were created

## DO: Set your seed

* Random number generators generate pseudo-random numbers based on an initial seed (usually a number or set of numbers)
    * In R you can use the **set.seed()** function to set the seed and to specify the random number generator to use
* Setting the seed allows for the stream of random numbers to be exactly reproducible
* Whenever you generate random numbers for a non-trivial purpose, **always set the seed**

## DO: Think about the entire pipeline

* Data analysis is a lengthy process: it is not just tables / figures / reports
* Raw data --> processed data --> analysis --> report
* How you got to the end is just as important as the end itself
* The more of the data analysis pipeline you can make reproducible, the better for everyone

## Summary: Checklist

* Are we doing good science
* Was any part of this analysis done by hand?
    * If so, are those parts *precisely* documented?
    * Does the documentation match reality?
* Have we taught the computer to do as much as possible (i.e. coded)?
* Are we using a version control system?
* Have we documented our software environment?
* Have we saved any output that we cannot reconstruct from original data + code?
* How far back in the analysis pipeline can we go before our results are no longer (automatically) reproducible?


# Evidence-based Data Analysis

## Replication and reproducibility

Replication

* Focuses on the validity of the scientific claim
* "Is the claim true?"
* The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence
* New investigators, data, analytical methods, laboratories, instruments, etc.
* Particularly important in the studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions

Reproducibility

* Focuses on the validity of the data analysis
* Can we trust this analysis?"
* Arguably a minimum standard for any scientific study
* New investigators, same data, same methods
* Important when replication is impossible

## Background and underlying trends

* Some studies cannot be replicated: no time, no money, unique/opportunistic
* Technology is increasing data collection throughput; data are more complex and high-dimensional
* Existing databases can be merged to become bigger databases (but data are used off-label)
* Computing power allows more sophisticated analyses, even on "small data"
* For every field "X" there is a "Computational X"

## The result?

* Even basic analyses are difficult
* Heavy computational requirements are thrust upon people without adequate training in statistics and computing
* Errors are more easily introduced into long analysis pipelines
* Knowledge transfer is inhibited
* Results are difficult to replicate or reproduce
* Complicated analyses cannot be trusted

## What is reproducibility?

![What is reproducibility?](./support/What_is_reproducibility.png "What is reproducibility?")

## What problem does reproducibility solve?

What we get

* transparency
* data availability
* software / methods availability
* improved transfer of knowledge

What we do NOT get

* validity / correctness of the analysis

An analysis can be reproducible and still be wrong

We want to know "can we trust this analysis?"

Does requiring reproducibility deter bad analysis?


## Problems with reproducibility

The premise of reproducible research is that with data/code available, people can check each other and the whole system is self-correcting

* Addresses the most "downstream" aspect of the research process - post publication

* Assumes everyone plays by the same rules and wants to achieve the same goals (i.e. scientific discovery)


## An analogy from asthma

## Scientific dissemination process

![](./support/Scientific_dissemination_process.png)


## Who reproduces research?

* For reproducibility to be effective as a means to check validity, someone needs to do something

    * Re-run the analysis; check results match
    * Check the code for bugs / errors
    * Try alternate approaches; check sensitivity
* The need for someone to do something is inherited from the traditional notion of replication
* Who is the "someone" and what are their goals?


Three kinds of people who reproduce research

![](./support/Who_reproduces_research.png)

## The story so far

* Reproducibility brings transparency (wrt code+data) and increased transfer of knowledge
* A lot of discussion about how to get people to share data
* Key question of "can we trust this analysis?" is not addressed by reproducibility
* Reproducibility addresses potential problems long after they've occurred ("downstream")
* Secondary analyses are inevitably coloured by the interests / motivations of others


## Evidence-based data analysis

* Most data analyses involve stringing together many different tools and methods
* Some methods may be standard for a given field, but others are often applied *ad hoc*
* We should apply thorogouhly studied (via statistical research), mutually agreed upon methods to analyze data whenever possible
* There should be evidence to justify the application of a given method

Take a standard histogram generated in R ... the bandwidth is generated automatically

![](./support/R_histogram_bandwidth.png)


* Create analytic pipelines from evidence-based components - standardize it
* Once an evidence-based analytic pipeline is established, we shouldn't mess with it
* Analysis with a "transparent box"
* Reduce the "researcher degree of freedom"
* Analogous to a pre-specified clinical trial protocol


### Deterministic statistical machine

![](./support/Deterministic_statistical_machine.png)

## Case study: Estimating acute effects of ambient air pollution exposure

* Acute / short-terms effects typically estimated via panel studies or time series studies
* Work originated in the late 1970s early 1980s
* Key question: "Are short-term changes in pollution associated with short-term changes in a population health outcome?"
* Studies usually conducted at community level
* Long history of statistical research investigating proper methods of analysis

* Can we encode everything that we have found in statistical / epidemiological research into a single package?
* Time series studies do not have a huge range of variation; typically involves similar types of data and similar questions
* We can create a deterministic statistical machine for this area


## DSM modules for time series studies of air pollution and health

1. Check for outliers, hig leverage, overdispersion
2. Fill in missing data? NO!
3. Model selection: estimate degrees of freedom to adjust for unmeasured confounders
    * other aspects of model not as critical
4. Multiple lag analysis
5. Sensitivity analysis wrt
    * unmeasured confounder adjustment
    * influential points


## Where to go from here?

* One DSM is not enough, we need many!
* Different problems warrant different approaches and expertise
* A curated library of machines providing state-of-the art analysis pipelines
* A CRAN / CPAN / CTAN / ... for data analysis
* Or a "Cochrane Collaboration" for data analysis


### A model: Cochrane Collaboration (evidence-based medicine)

![](./support/Cochrane_collaboration.png)

![](./support/Cochrane_example.png)


## A curated library of data analysis

* Provide packages that encode data analysis pipelines for given problems, technologies, questions
* Curated by experts knowledgeable in the field
* Documentation / references given supporting each module in the pipeline
* Changes introduced after passing relevant benchmarks / unit tests


# Summary

* Reproducible research is important, but does not necessarily solve the critical question of whether a data analysis is trustworthy
* Reproducible research focuses on the most "downstream" aspect of research dissemination
* Evidence-based data analysis would provide standardised, best practices for given scientific areas and questions
* Gives reviewers an important tool without dramatically increasing the burden on them
* More effort should be put into improving the quality of "upstream" aspects of scientific research
