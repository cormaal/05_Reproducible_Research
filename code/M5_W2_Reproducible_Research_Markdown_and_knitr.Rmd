# Markdown and knitr

## Coding Standards for R

1. Always use text files / text editor
2. Indent your code
    - indenting improves readability
    - suggested: indents of 4 spaces at a minimum; 8 spaces ideal
3. Limit the width of your code (80 columns?)
    - fixing line length prevents lots of nesting and very long functions
4. Limit the length of individual functions
    - limit it to one basic activity, i.e. only read data or process data, or fit a model or print some output
    - helps with debugging
