# Markdown and knitr

## Coding Standards for R

1. Always use text files / text editor
2. Indent your code
    - indenting improves readability
    - suggested: indents of 4 spaces at a minimum; 8 spaces ideal
3. Limit the width of your code (80 columns?)
    - fixing line length prevents lots of nesting and very long functions
4. Limit the length of individual functions
    - limit it to one basic activity, i.e. only read data or process data, or fit a model or print some output
    - helps with debugging

## Introduction to Markdown

### What is markdown?

*Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).*

John Gruber, creator of markdown

### Markdown syntax

- Italics: wrap text in single asterisks or underscores
- Bold: wrap text in double asterisks or underscores
- Italics and bold: wrap text in triple asterisks or asterisks and underscores
- Strikethrough: wrap text in double tildes
- Headings: use hashtags to create 1st, 2nd ... 6th level headings
- Bulleted lists: use a dash (or any other character consistently across the list) and a space at the beginning of the line
- Numbered lists: use a number, a full stop and a space
- Indents: at least one leading space at the beginning of a line - introduces a blank line above and an indent by the number of spaces
- Links: enclose the link text in square brackets followed by the link address in round brackets
- Advanced linking: enclose the link text in square brackets immediately followed by a number in square brackets. Later on in the document list all the links with the number in square brackets followed by a colon followed by the link address followed by the link text in quotation marks
- Newlines: requires a double space at the end of a line
- See the Github cheatsheet the following formatting tips:
    - images
    - code and syntax highlighting
    - footnotes
    - tables
    - blockquotes
    - inline HTML
    - horizontal rule
